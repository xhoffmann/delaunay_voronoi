# delaunay_voronoi
Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi tessellation in Python.

## Basics

Given a set of points in an Euclidean 2D space, we compute the [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation)
using the [Bowyer-Watson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowyer%E2%80%93Watson_algorithm). 
We compute the [Voronoi tessellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) as 
the dual graph of the Delaunay triangulation.
